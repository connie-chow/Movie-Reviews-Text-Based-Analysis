Reptile,Michael Cook,rotten,4/10,"It's too convoluted and it feels like a low-rent ""True Detective"". At the heart of it, it could have been fantastic, but the execution of this film was poorly done.","Oct 6, 2023"
Reptile,Abhishek Srivastava,fresh,3/5,"Reptile shines in various aspects, and its flaws can easily be overlooked. Watch it for Del Toro's compelling performance and Fincher's influence (particularly in the first half).","Oct 6, 2023"
Reptile,Hope Madden,fresh,3/5,"Some leaps of logic lessen a well acted, twisty thriller.","Oct 6, 2023"
Reptile,Leo Brady,rotten,2/4,"Sadly, you still need to stick the landing, and Reptile does a good job of drawing us into the mystery, it just rushes the ending and that feels like a crime.","Oct 6, 2023"
Reptile,Frank Swietek,rotten,C+,"Gets points for holding your interest, but loses them for botching the close...it twists itself into such pretzel formations in an attempt to surprise that by the end the ludicrousness has overwhelmed the mood it worked so hard to establish.","Oct 5, 2023"
Reptile,Mark Jackson,fresh,3/5,"Benicio Del Toro makes this whole thing work. If it were an hour and a half, it'd be a 4-star. At it's current unwieldy length, it's a 3-star. Still a good watch.","Oct 5, 2023"
Reptile,Giovanni Lago,rotten,5/10,"""Reptile"" isn't a terrible film. There will be a specific crowd that enjoys it. There are just better offerings out there.","Oct 4, 2023"
Reptile,Luke Buckmaster,fresh,,"A very absorbing whodunnit procedural assembled with cooly unnerving aplomb, like a David Fincher thriller.","Oct 3, 2023"
Reptile,Rich Cline,fresh,3/5,"Frustratingly, the underlying themes aren't robust enough to make this vastly overlong film very memorable, rehashing the usual exhausted good cop scenario. It's beautifully shot and acted, but a bit more earthy momentum would have given it a real kick.","Oct 3, 2023"
Reptile,Kambole Campbell,rotten,2/5,"Del Toro’s solid screen charisma can’t rescue Reptile, a derivative and lethargic thriller that rarely thrills as it tries and fails to build a case for itself as a meaningful iteration on the detective thrillers that it admires.","Oct 3, 2023"
Reptile,Dennis Schwartz,rotten,C+,After a fast start the middle part falters.,"Oct 3, 2023"
Reptile,Marshall Shaffer,rotten,,"Like the snake of its title, it slithers ominously enough to send some shivers up the spine. But it’s also a bit too slow and deliberate for its own good, even if its venomous bite can draw some blood.","Oct 3, 2023"
Reptile,Edward Porter,rotten,2/5,Benicio del Toro is unsurprising but constantly watchable. It helps that the character’s marriage avoids cop-movie clichés by being fairly happy.,"Oct 2, 2023"
Reptile,Guillermo Courau,rotten,2.5/5,"And in the aimless comings and goings, Reptiles becomes increasingly less attractive. [Full review in Spanish]","Oct 2, 2023"
Reptile,Pablo O. Scholz,fresh,3/4,"The film has a concise script, which gradually opens rifts for us to find out along with Tom, from the armchair at home, what is behind the real estate business. [Full review in Spanish]","Oct 2, 2023"
Reptile,Robert Abele,rotten,,The fallout from all this purposeful gloom isn't merely that nothing surprises us; even Del Toro's committed portrayal of a careful man's gathering disillusionment gets jammed up.,"Oct 2, 2023"
Reptile,Roger Moore,rotten,2/4,"It's perfectly watchable, but let it play on during the bathroom breaks and search for snacks. It's so slow you probably won't miss anything vital, not until the third act.","Oct 2, 2023"
Reptile,Erik Childress,rotten,2/4,If it more closely focused on Del Toro & Silverstone's mutual deductions on the crimes at hand it may have had something. Instead it feels like all those twisty thrillers in the wake of The Usual Suspects until you're wondering what was all that about.,"Oct 2, 2023"
Reptile,Daniel M. Kimmel,fresh,3/5,"Del Toro, who worked on the script crafted by director Grant Singer and Benjamin Brewer, has a meaty role that – like much of the cast – plays him against type.","Oct 2, 2023"
Reptile,Allen Almachar,fresh,B-,"It’s handsomely made with strong, committed performances, but it plays so closely to the blueprint that it never establishes an identity of its own.","Oct 2, 2023"
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Adam Graham,fresh,A-,"Taken as a whole, and the four films should be watched together, it's a deeply significant work for Anderson, and one of the year's best movies, no matter how you parse it.","Oct 6, 2023"
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Eileen Jones,rotten,,"I promise not to review the rest of Wes Anderson’s Roald Dahl adaptations when they come out. I can see them already without the use of my eyes, just like Imdad Khan in The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar.","Oct 6, 2023"

The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Jennifer Green,fresh,4/5,"If Dahl's original work offered a peek into the writing process, Anderson's retelling does the same for the staging process.","Oct 6, 2023"
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Luke Goodsell,fresh,,"It's yet another sign that Anderson is only getting weirder, and more wondrous, the further he plunges into middle age.","Oct 5, 2023"
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Max Cea,fresh,,"Watching Henry Sugar, perhaps more so than any other film I’ve seen, gives the sensation of being read a great picture-book -- albeit one that is fully alive, cinematic, and age-agnostic.","Oct 5, 2023"
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Whang Yee Ling,fresh,5/5,"Dahl and Anderson are kindred spirits in whimsy, fully simpatico.","Oct 5, 2023"
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Craig Mathieson,fresh,4/5,"Roald Dahl’s work has always been a salve to children in need, acknowledging the cruelty of the wider world and celebrating inventive defiance. With these short films Wes Anderson shows how that still matters.","Oct 5, 2023"
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Keith Garlington,fresh,4.5/5,There’s such a wonky harmony between Dahl’s words and Anderson’s profoundly unique style which makes this quirky short film such a delight.,"Oct 5, 2023"
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Sam Adams,fresh,,Anderson has said it was the story’s nesting-doll structure that drew him to Henry Sugar in the first place... and he realizes its concentric narratives with dazzling fluidity.,"Oct 3, 2023"

The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Rob Gonsalves,fresh,A,"Those who eagerly await the newest American Empirical Picture will be entranced, as usual, by the toybox sets and the people standing stock still like toy figures inside immaculate compositions.","Oct 3, 2023"
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Richard Brody,fresh,,"Lest viewers become even briefly comfortable with the enchantments of his staging and of his actors’ performances, Anderson jolts them alert with ever more audacious contrivances.","Oct 3, 2023"
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Martín Fernández Cruz,fresh,4/5,"... With Wes Anderson's perspective, this story becomes a small visual epic. [Full review in Spanish]","Oct 2, 2023"
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Wendy Ide,fresh,4/5,"This is an archetypal Anderson film: mannered, fussy, obsessively designed – normally irksome traits, but in this alchemic instance it’s an utterly delightful combination.","Oct 1, 2023"
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Jonathon Wilson,fresh,4/5,The reunion of Dahl’s writing and Anderson’s filmmaking for the first time since Fantastic Mr. Fox yields similarly wonderful results.,"Sep 30, 2023"
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Chris Bumbray,fresh,,Wes Anderson's most enjoyable work since The Grand Budapest Hotel,"Sep 30, 2023"
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Nuha Hassan,fresh,,The imaginative world of Anderson's cinematic universe can never replicated. His work evokes a poise and elegant feeling that is impossible to imitate.,"Sep 30, 2023"
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Kevin Carr,fresh,4/4,"A perfect mix of the different quirkiness of Roald Dahl and Wes Anderson, this is as relevant today as it ever was.","Sep 29, 2023"
No One Will Save You,Jim Laczkowski,rotten,2.5/5,"Sadly, the lack of dialogue feels more like a gimmick than a strength of the storytelling here. Dever is terrific as always but where it ends up going can't help but feel like a letdown.","Oct 7, 2023"
No One Will Save You,Jordy Sirkin,rotten,,It presents a classic sci-fi invasion story while offering its own unique elements. But it overstays its welcome in some aspects that feel repetitive.,"Oct 7, 2023"
No One Will Save You,Emiliano Basile,fresh,8/10,"It is a horror film that's different, not only because it is very well made but also because it allows for a double reading. [Full review in Spanish]","Oct 7, 2023"
No One Will Save You,Alex Hudson,fresh,7/10,"Dever commands the screen as the only character of note, doing a good job at wordlessly conveying awkwardness, guilt, melancholy and fear.","Oct 6, 2023"
No One Will Save You,Joe Lipsett,fresh,4/5,"A nearly wordless alien invasion film that doesn't pull punches? Yes, Brian Duffield and Kaitlyn Dever have accomplished just that. It's incredible.","Oct 6, 2023"
No One Will Save You,Chris Wasser,fresh,3/5,"It lays on too many ideas in a frantic third act, making it hard to follow and near-impossible to digest. We cannot, however, fault its ambition. Duffield is on to something here, and a tremendous Dever just about holds it together. Half a great sci-fi.","Oct 5, 2023"
No One Will Save You,Craig Mathieson,rotten,,"Dever gives a charged performance defined by her physical commitment and latent traces of regret. It’s an anchor that holds a tenuous story in place for most of Brian Duffield’s movie, although landing the haywire conclusion is beyond even Dever’s reach.","Oct 5, 2023"
No One Will Save You,Manuel Betancourt,fresh,,"Dever remains utterly transfixing every second she's on screen... you're with her the entire film, and she really sells it.","Oct 4, 2023"

No One Will Save You,Rob Gonsalves,fresh,B+,"The filmmaking, proceeding by image and sound alone, is nicely accomplished pure cinema. There wouldn’t be much of a movie, though, if it didn’t have an expressive actor like Kaitlyn Dever at its center.","Oct 3, 2023"
No One Will Save You,Robert Levin,fresh,3.5/4,Dever is simply exceptional. And the movie as a whole is about as high quality of a genre picture as you could hope to find while scrolling through Hulu.,"Oct 3, 2023"
No One Will Save You,Eddie Harrison,fresh,3/5,…the dreamlike No One Will Save You is intense and gripping as Kaitlyn’s situation unfolds; it’s only afterwards that wound-up audiences will be left searching for more information about what they’ve just seen…,"Oct 3, 2023"
No One Will Save You,Paula Vázquez Prieto,fresh,4/5,"As in the best films, less is more and with the right resources and locations you can weave a perfect fable in which the most restorative dreams are without a doubt the cruelest nightmares. [Full review in Spanish]","Oct 2, 2023"
No One Will Save You,Rob Hunter,fresh,,Kaitlyn Dever is quietly becoming one of the all-time greats.,"Oct 2, 2023"

No One Will Save You,Kevin Harley,fresh,4/5,The result is an intense and often ingenious exercise in suspense.,"Sep 29, 2023"
No One Will Save You,Robin Holabird,rotten,,"Ultimately though, the payoff feels slightly more confusing or pointless than either of those, giving No One Will Save You points for bold effort and skillful moviemaking without a final, captivating twist...","Sep 29, 2023"
No One Will Save You,Matt Hudson,fresh,3.5/5,"On a technical level, No One Will Save You is a strong effort, but outside of that, it fails to be overly compelling, save for Dever’s engaging performance.","Sep 29, 2023"
The Beasts,Alejandro Lingenti,fresh,4/5,The Beasts is seductive and captivating because Alejandro de Pablo makes a photographic work that is as poetic as it is functional. [Full review in Spanish],"Oct 6, 2023"
The Beasts,Sergio Burstein,fresh,,"Impressive in its setting, positive outlook, and in its reference to character development. [Full review in Spanish]","Oct 5, 2023"
The Beasts,Sarah Boslaugh,fresh,7/10,...a profoundly upsetting story given a gripping treatment...,"Sep 26, 2023"
The Beasts,Farah Cheded,fresh,,"A slow-burn Spanish thriller hissing with menacing energy and brilliant performances [...] Beautifully shot yet spiritually ugly, [it] plunges us straight into an atmosphere of crackling social tension that never abates.","Sep 16, 2023"
The Beasts,Jorge Ignacio Castillo,fresh,4/5,"The Beasts trades on topics so current it feels like watching the news. While not quite a re-enactment, this superb thriller takes inspiration from oh-so-many immigrants who find themselves at the receiving end of the locals’ misplaced anger.","Aug 31, 2023"
The Beasts,Laura Hiros,fresh,4/5,"""As Bestas"", its original title in Galician, will do with its deep plot, its extraordinary performances, its leisurely pace and its impeccable cinematography that your blood starts freezing slowly...[Full Review in Spanish}","Aug 18, 2023"
The Beasts,Claudia Puig,fresh,,A well-made and eerie thriller.,"Aug 17, 2023"
The Beasts,Chris Knight,fresh,A,Sorogoyen based The Beasts on a true-crime story that took place in his native Spain more than a decade ago. But it’s burnished with storytelling flourishes that energize this story of a dispute between an immigrant couple and rural locals.,"Aug 11, 2023"
The Beasts,Carlos Aguilar,fresh,,"For its second half, in the aftermath of a twist that shouldn’t be spoiled, the film takes on an unexpected depth and even a semblance of closure, though it shouldn’t be a surprise that no one fully gets what they want.","Aug 7, 2023"
The Beasts,Morgan Rojas,fresh,4/5,A simmering piece of filmmaking (with a gorgeously organic soundtrack) that broods with tension and despair.,"Aug 4, 2023"
The Beasts,Josh Goller,fresh,4/5,"By juxtaposing natural majesty with human depravity, Sorogoyen’s film reminds us how quickly an idyllic dream can turn into a nightmare.","Aug 1, 2023"
The Beasts,Kyle Smith,fresh,,"In balancing the two sides’ competing motives, Mr. Sorogoyen has fashioned not only a taut drama but a parable that is widely applicable across many cultures at this moment.","Aug 1, 2023"
The Beasts,Andy Crump,fresh,9.5/10,"Sorogoyen constructs this destructive exercise in dick-swinging with firm, lyrical visual language","Jul 31, 2023"
The Beasts,Simon Abrams,fresh,3/4,"“The Beasts” may not be realistic, but it is genuinely eerie.","Jul 28, 2023"
The Beasts,Peter Debruge,fresh,,"A deeply uncomfortable portrait of everyday evil that’s all the more terrifying for being true — not the two main characters, who are fictional, but the conflict that comes to define their new life in that wild corner of northwest Spain.","Jul 28, 2023"
The Beasts,Todd Jorgenson,fresh,,"Exploring dark universal themes with rich cultural specificity, this captivating thriller builds steady tension around its feuding characters.","Jul 28, 2023"
The Beasts,Filipe Freitas,fresh,5/5,"Benefitting from incredibly sincere performances from the four leads, Sorogoyen doles out a dark, shattering piece of filmmaking that is as brutal as it is essential.","Jul 28, 2023"
The Beasts,Josh Parham,fresh,7/10,"Director Rodrigo Sorogoyen carefully calibrates the tension quite effectively, letting silences build the stress between every unsaid word that leads to violent action.","Jul 28, 2023"
The Beasts,Nick Schager,fresh,,"A controlled and concise pot-boiler of stresses and strains that nobody is capable of managing, much less quelling.","Jul 28, 2023"

Talk to Me,Sergio Burstein,fresh,,The majority of the feature demonstrates the capacity of the Phillipou's to be at the service of their characters and for their fabrication of a tense environment that is more and more desperate.  [Full review in Spanish],"Oct 5, 2023"
Talk to Me,Rubén Rosario,rotten,,"It works like gangbusters until it really doesn't. Still, there is something to be said for a near miss that leaves you somewhat intrigued for what the filmmakers will do next.","Oct 2, 2023"
Talk to Me,Tomás Andrés,fresh,4/5,"It has a good rhythm and curated visual work - characters that appear slightly blurred, dark lighting, overwhelming close-ups - that contributes to creating a disturbing atmosphere throughout the film. [Full review in Spanish]","Sep 29, 2023"
Talk to Me,Anthony Gagliardi,fresh,,"Talk to Me is TWISTED, TERRIFYING, and the BEST HORROR film of the year. Directors Danny and Michael Philippou deliver inventive and genuine scares that will linger long after watching.","Sep 27, 2023"

Talk to Me,John Serba,fresh,,"Although Talk to Me isn’t particularly innovative, it does show considerable skill from the Philippous, who show some inspired visual acumen and keenly balance the gross/scary/funny equation, two things that better horror films do.","Sep 18, 2023"
Talk to Me,Nadine Whitney,fresh,A+,"Talk to Me is a sleek, frightening, and unique construction that digs into teen loneliness and dispossession through actual possession. It is literally bone crunching and ferocious with gore aplenty but is also empathetic.","Sep 6, 2023"
Talk to Me,Bob Grimm,fresh,3.75/5,"It's committed to the darkness of its premise, and I like that.","Sep 2, 2023"
Talk to Me,Daniel Rester,fresh,,"Despite its minor issues, Talk to Me is still a hell of a debut feature and an excellent Australian horror picture. Wilde is absolutely terrific in it as Mia and the Philippous inject new ideas into ancient formulas.","Aug 26, 2023"

Talk to Me,Jorge Rivera Rubio,rotten,2/5,"The concept is cool. The performances are solid, with a haunting atmosphere that keeps the tension going during crucial moments... but I couldn't connect at all. [Full review in Spanish]","Aug 18, 2023"
Talk to Me,Cris Parker,fresh,,A refreshing Horror film that builds on its story & characters over just visuals that will shock you. Fantastic film.,"Aug 16, 2023"
Talk to Me,Paul Salfen,fresh,8.5/10,"The shock value of the violence and terrifying imagery is enough to stay with you long after you leave the theater so be warned. However, cinephiles will know that since it's an A24 film, it's going to stand out in more than a cheap jump scare way.","Aug 16, 2023"
Talk to Me,Matthew Pejkovic,fresh,4/5,"A frightening and innovative tale of grief, loneliness, and the dire consequences of messing with the dark arts.","Aug 16, 2023"

Gran Turismo,Mark McPherson,fresh,,It’s a well-shot movie with racing that makes up for the ho-hum drama that unfolds off the track. There’s a certain tension to see how the stellar racing footage can pick up the slack of a rather paint-by-numbers sports biography.,"Sep 8, 2023"
