Everything Everywhere All at Once,Tina Kakadelis,fresh,,"Everything Everywhere All At Once is a spectacle in the purest sense of the word. A sensory overload, especially in IMAX, the movie is a science fiction, multi-verse spanning love letter to family.","Jul 25, 2023"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,Isabel Ong,fresh,,Delightfully disorienting and intellectually absorbing.,"May 26, 2023"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,Cole Smithey,rotten,ZERO,"""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is a steaming example of visual, sonic, and thematic noise. Chinese propaganda for propaganda's sake. Vomiting all of the time now. Hollywood pawns.","May 11, 2023"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,Greg Carlson,fresh,,"At a few minutes short of two and a half hours, Everything Everywhere All at Once nearly wears out its welcome, but as far as hot dog-fingered audacity goes, the Daniels will make plenty of new eyeballs go googly.","May 9, 2023"

The Daniels provide a supreme sci-fi smorgasbord for the ages.","Mar 22, 2023"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,Milana Vujkov,rotten,2/5,"It holds within it a great idea, when one disentangles it from the hairball that is the EEAAO narrative.

Everything Everywhere All at Once,Robin Holabird,fresh,,"Outrageous, confusing or confounding, Everything Everywhere All At Once stands out as one of the most original movies to come along in years.","Mar 16, 2023"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,A.S. Hamrah,rotten,,"The humor, though, is silly and second-rate. The googly eyes, the talking raccoon, the pet rocks at sunset, the parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey—all those work against the cast instead of with it.","Mar 16, 2023"
Everything Everywhere All at Once,Eric Webb,fresh,A,"Much like a hallucinogen might cause you to cycle through every human emotion and see your life laid out end to end — theoretically — this film has an ability to dazzle built into every kinetic, colorful, madcap frame.","Mar 16, 2023"

Nomadland,Keith Garlington,fresh,4.5/5,"From a Nevada desert through the South Dakota Badlands to the Pacific coast, “Nomadland” is a work of visual poetry, but it’s the human element at its core that gives it such an emotional pull.","Aug 24, 2022"

Parasite,Jae-Ha Kim,fresh,4/4,"""Parasite"" has already made history for South Korea as the country's first film to win a Best Picture Academy Award. There are some moments I can't wrap my head around though, and one of them was the inclusion of Illinois State into the dialogue.","Jul 28, 2023"
Parasite,Manuel São Bento,fresh,A+,"Cinematography, score, editing… everything’s absolutely perfect. Nothing is placed without purpose. Not a single line of dialogue is wasted.

Parasite,Paul Kanieski,fresh,,"Radically different films such as Knives Out, Us and Joker ... have all expressed the same social criticism. Parasite is perhaps the most pointed, explicitly showing how economic inequality brings out the worst in everyone, rich and poor alike.","Jul 20, 2023"
Parasite,Mark Johnson,fresh,,"Bong Joon Ho’s many-sided, dark social satire is a cunning and resourceful commentary on South Korea’s economic inequality. Why it works is the relevance of that system across societies of every nation.","Jun 14, 2023"

Parasite,Victor Pineyro,fresh,10/10,"Delicate directing and immaculate production design make Parasite the masterpiece it is.

Parasite,Keith Garlington,fresh,4.5/5,"With a delicious black comedy edge, some surprising jolts of heartfelt emotion, and a violent throat punch when you’re least expecting it, “Parasite” is a movie that keeps you engaged and guessing.","Aug 24, 2022"
Parasite,M.N. Miller,fresh,4.5/5,"Here is a dark comedy from the great Bong Joon-Ho about class warfare that, depending on your mood, you may find to be a work of genius or too self-indulgent. One thing is certain, you’ve never seen anything quite like it.","Aug 20, 2022"

Greenbook,Ben Turner,fresh,4/5,"This is a deftly scripted comedy with a message. Anchored by two outstanding performances, this true story of an unlikely friendship will warm even the most jaded of hearts with its comic look on a dark chapter of American history.","Sep 1, 2021"
Greenbook,Nicolás Delgadillo,rotten,2.,It's irresponsible and dismissive of the very thing it seemingly wants to talk about.,"Jun 25, 2021"
Greenbook,Alex Bentley,rotten,,"With so many other recent movies finding a way to address racial issues in both entertaining and considerate methods, Green Book feels like a wrongheaded throwback. It may give you some good feelings, but its message is only half-baked.","Apr 29, 2021"
Greenbook,Joanne Laurier,fresh,,"For its humanistic, anti-racialist message-the elementary notion that white and black people can get along-Green Book has been well received by audiences.","Feb 17, 2021"

Greenbook,Jason Fraley,fresh,4/4,"""Green Book"" is one of those rare crowd pleasers with the chops to go the Oscar distance. It's a film most easily described as a reverse ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (1989) when really it's so much more than that.","Aug 29, 2020"

The Shape of Water,Ian Brill,fresh,,"A romance between two characters who never speak which means Del Toro must depict their love only in visuals. This leads to many beautiful cinematic scenes, including one of the most unique, and but wonderful, sex scenes in recent years.","Apr 13, 2021"
The Shape of Water,Tori Brazier,fresh,4/5,"... Worthy of acclaim for its bold imagination, design and straddling of genres, as well as a heavy-weight cast, but it's perhaps more conventional than people might expect.","Mar 25, 2021"
