The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Roger Moore,fresh,2.5/4,"It’s not among Dahl’s greatest hits or Anderson’s grand meringue delights, but “Henry Sugar” amuses here and there and passes by quickly, unlike the interminable “Asteroid City” and sometimes strained earlier Anderson outings.","Sep 29, 2023"

The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,Jack King,fresh,,"The movie whips past in a moment, a result of the combined pace of the dialogue and sets that shift and morph endlessly; it's like trying to keep up with a speeding hare on your hands and feet.","Sep 28, 2023"

No One Will Save You,Paul Whitington,fresh,3/5,"The sound design is excellent, the decision to almost entirely avoid dialogue daring, but No One Will Save You unravels somewhat in a hurried ending, and should perhaps have remained small and resisted the temptation to explain itself.","Sep 28, 2023"

Talk to Me,John Serba,fresh,,"Although Talk to Me isn’t particularly innovative, it does show considerable skill from the Philippous, who show some inspired visual acumen and keenly balance the gross/scary/funny equation, two things that better horror films do.","Sep 18, 2023"
Talk to Me,Nadine Whitney,fresh,A+,"Talk to Me is a sleek, frightening, and unique construction that digs into teen loneliness and dispossession through actual possession. It is literally bone crunching and ferocious with gore aplenty but is also empathetic.","Sep 6, 2023"

Talk to Me,Paul Salfen,fresh,8.5/10,"The shock value of the violence and terrifying imagery is enough to stay with you long after you leave the theater so be warned.

Gran Turismo,Neal Pollack,fresh,3/5,"While not as good as two other recent car-racing movies, Ron Howard’s ‘Rush’ and James Mangold’s ‘Ford V. Ferrari,’ ‘Gran Turismo’ is still a fairly effective underdog story with some cool driving scenes.","Sep 17, 2023"

Gran Turismo,Sean P. Means,fresh,3/4,"The chief joy derived in “Gran Turismo,” — aside from the delight Blomkamp shows in editing together tight racing sequences — is watching Harbour tear through all the gruff-but-lovable coaching cliches and find the battered, vulnerable heart within.","Sep 10, 2023"
Gran Turismo,Mark McPherson,fresh,,It’s a well-shot movie with racing that makes up for the ho-hum drama that unfolds off the track. There’s a certain tension to see how the stellar racing footage can pick up the slack of a rather paint-by-numbers sports biography.,"Sep 8, 2023"

Gran Turismo,Paula Vázquez Prieto,fresh,3/5,"What enriches the film the most, conceived under the mantra of ""based on a true story"" to make us believe the impossible, is an outsider's look at an elite tournament like GT or Formula 1. [Full review in Spanish]","Sep 7, 2023"
Gran Turismo,Stephen Silver,rotten,2/5,"The level of sports movie cliché is almost overwhelming; as is the notion that this movie about a craven marketing exercise is, itself, a craven marketing exercise.","Sep 7, 2023"

Blue Beetle,John Serba,fresh,,"It’s best to appreciate the familial/community bond that bolsters Blue Beetle’s heroism; the world doesn’t need another superhero movie, but it really doesn’t need another Batman-loner type.","Sep 27, 2023"
Blue Beetle,Harris Dang,fresh,3/5,"Blue Beetle is an amiable, sincere, and fitfully enjoyable piece in the superhero genre that entertains and engages in both thrills and poignancy thanks to its grounded approach and Soto’s focus on family over special effects. Recommended.","Sep 24, 2023"
Blue Beetle,Tim Miller,fresh,3/4,"Blue Beetle’s director, Angel Manuel Soto, and screenwriter, Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, could have concocted a family comedy with these engaging characters, eliminating the trite superhero theatrics, and they probably would have had a stronger film.","Sep 23, 2023"

Bottoms,Felix Vasquez Jr.,rotten,,"Is it “Superbad” or “Jawbreaker”? The screenplay doesn’t seem to ever decide on a direction, which hinders the film, reducing it to something of a chore, and often a bore.","Sep 29, 2023"
Bottoms,John Serba,fresh,,"Seligman’s loosey-goosey approach to tone and plotting feels carefully designed to keep us off-kilter and therefore vulnerable to the film’s brand of blindside, kidney-punch comedy.","Sep 28, 2023"
